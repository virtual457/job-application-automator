# Work Experience Database - Reference Material

**Last Updated:** November 18, 2025
**Purpose:** Reference database of actual work done at LSEG and Infosys - USE THIS TO GENERATE CUSTOM BULLETS

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: How to Use This Database

**DO NOT copy these bullets verbatim into YAML!**

**Instead:**
1. Read the JD and identify what's relevant
2. Review this database to understand what work was actually done
3. **Generate NEW bullets** that emphasize JD-relevant aspects of the work
4. Use real metrics and technologies from database
5. Tailor language and focus to match JD keywords

**Example:**

**For AWS/Serverless JD:**
- Database shows: LSEG used AWS Lambda, SQS, 40% latency reduction
- **Generate:** "Optimized **AWS Lambda-based microservices** with **SQS** message queues, achieving **40% latency reduction** through batch processing tuning and cold-start optimization."

**For AI/Automation JD:**
- Database shows: LSEG did workflow orchestration, 35% improvement, priority routing
- **Generate:** "Implemented **AI-powered workflow orchestration** with **intelligent priority routing**, reducing processing time by **35%** through automated decision-making."

## HOW TO GENERATE CUSTOM BULLETS

### Step 1: Understand the JD Focus

**Ask yourself:**
- What technologies does the JD emphasize? (Python? AWS? Java? Kubernetes?)
- What type of work? (Backend? ML? Data? Automation?)
- What keywords appear most? (Performance? Scale? Reliability? AI?)

### Step 2: Map JD Keywords to Actual Work

**Example for Adobe AI Developer (AI Agents, Workflows, Automation):**

**LSEG work that's relevant:**
- ✅ Workflow orchestration (KYC/AML screening)
- ✅ Intelligent routing (priority queue management)
- ✅ Automated systems (event-driven pipeline)
- ✅ Python + AWS (Lambda, SQS)
- ✅ Cross-functional collaboration

**Generate bullets emphasizing these:**
1. Workflow orchestration + automation
2. Intelligent routing/decision-making
3. Event-driven systems
4. API development for integration
5. Team collaboration

### Step 3: Write Custom Bullets Using Real Metrics

**Use factual foundation from database:**
- 7.5M+ records, 180+ countries, 40 records/sec ✓
- 35% improvement, 40% latency reduction, 99.9% integrity ✓
- AWS Lambda, SQS, Python, Java ✓
- 5 engineers mentored, 7 teams collaborated ✓

**But phrase them to match JD:**

**For AI/Automation role:**
```
Implemented **automated workflow orchestration** for compliance screening, reducing manual processing by **35%** through **intelligent priority routing** and **AI-ready pipeline** architecture.
```

**For AWS/Cloud role:**
```
Architected **AWS serverless microservices** using **Lambda and SQS**, processing **7.5M+ records** across **180+ countries** with **40% latency reduction** through performance optimization.
```

**For Java/Enterprise role:**
```
Developed **enterprise-grade Java microservices** with **Micronaut framework**, deployed on **AWS Lambda**, achieving **99.9% data integrity** and **low-latency CRUD operations** for financial services.
```

### Step 4: Apply Bold Markers Strategically

**Bold 3-5 key terms per bullet:**
- Technologies: `**AWS Lambda**`, `**Python**`, `**Java Micronaut**`
- Metrics: `**7.5M+ records**`, `**40% improvement**`, `**99.9% uptime**`
- Concepts: `**event-driven**`, `**microservices**`, `**workflow orchestration**`

### Step 5: Ensure Factual Accuracy

**Always verify:**
- ✅ Metrics match database (don't inflate)
- ✅ Technologies actually used (don't claim false experience)
- ✅ Achievements are real (based on reference material)
- ✅ Phrasing is professional and truthful
