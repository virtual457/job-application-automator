## ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

### Unique Strengths

1.  **8-month co-op availability** (Jan-Aug 2026) - longer than typical summer interns
2.  **Production experience** at recognized financial services company (LSEG)
3.  **Go + Kubernetes** expertise - rare for students
4.  **Full-stack capabilities** - both frontend and backend
5.  **Flexible start date** - can start anytime Jan-May 2026
6.  **Geographic flexibility** - can relocate anywhere
7.  **Strong academic performance** - 3.89 GPA at top university

### Positioning Strategies

**For Backend/Distributed Systems Roles:**

-   Lead with LSEG experience (7.5M records, 180 countries)
-   Emphasize Python, Java, AWS serverless
-   Projects: Orion Platform, Port Management, Calendly

**For ML/AI Roles:**

-   Lead with LMARO (RAG, LangChain ReAct, Multi-Agent) or Dino Deep RL (1.5M parameters, PyTorch)
-   Emphasize GPU training, neural networks, agent frameworks
-   Projects: LMARO, Dino RL, Face Recognition, PUBG Analysis

**For Full-Stack Roles:**

-   Lead with Kambaz LMS (Next.js + Node.js)
-   Emphasize React, TypeScript, Redux
-   Projects: Kambaz, Port Management, Online Exam

**For DevOps/Platform Engineering:**

-   Lead with Kubernetes Operator (Go, k8s)
-   Emphasize containerization, infrastructure-as-code
-   Projects: Orion Platform, LSEG microservices

**For Data Engineering:**

-   Lead with PUBG analysis (4.4M records)
-   Emphasize ETL pipelines, data processing
-   Projects: PUBG Analysis, LSEG data pipelines, Port Management

### Addressing Overqualification Concerns

-   Always use "Software Engineer" not "Senior Software Engineer"
-   Emphasize learning orientation and Northeastern co-op requirement
-   Frame as "one year of coursework remaining after internship"
-   Position through Northeastern's institutional framework
-   De-emphasize leadership, emphasize collaboration

### F1 Visa Talking Points

-   CPT (Curricular Practical Training) requires ZERO employer sponsorship
-   No costs or paperwork for employer beyond signing offer letter
-   Northeastern's co-op program is CPT-integrated
-   Can work 8 months on CPT (longer than H1B considerations)
